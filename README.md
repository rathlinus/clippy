# Setup Guide

## Step 1: Download
Download the APK file.

## Step 2: Install
Install the APK. You may be prompted to allow installation from unknown sources. The app can be scanned by Play Protect for safety.

## Step 3: Set as Default Browser
Open **Settings** on your device, go to **Apps > Default Apps > Browser App**, and select **Clippy** as your default browser.

## Step 4: Usage
Now, whenever you click on a link that would normally open in a browser, Clippy will automatically copy the URL to your clipboard without opening it.

## Step 5: Restore Default Browser
When you’re done, don’t forget to change your default browser back to your preferred app.
